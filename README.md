## Building the BitCurator distro (current release)

The BitCurator GitHub organization currently includes two core repositories required to build the BitCurator environment:

- BitCurator SaltStack deployment states and instructions: bitcurator-salt (https://github.com/bitcurator/bitcurator-salt)
- BitCurator CLI Installer: bitcurator-cli (https://github.com/bitcurator/bitcurator-cli)

The BitCurator environment is a customized variant of Ubuntu. Aside from the initial Ubuntu install, the process is fully automated by SaltStack. To get started with the deployment process, follow the link to **bitcurator-salt** above.
