## Building the BitCurator distro (for developers)

The BitCurator GitHub organization currently includes two core repositories required to build the BitCurator environment:

- bitcurator-distro-salt (https://github.com/bitcurator/bitcurator-distro-salt)
- bitcurator-distro-tools (https://github.com/bitcurator/bitcurator-distro-tools)

The BitCurator environment is a customized respin of Ubuntu. Aside from the initial Ubuntu install, a small number of manual tweaks, and executing the respin tool, the process is fully automated by SaltStack. To get started building and testing a new release, follow the link to **bitcurator-distro-salt** above.
