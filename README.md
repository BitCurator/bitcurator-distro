## Building the BitCurator distro (for developers)

The BitCurator GitHub organization currently includes two core repositories that support building the BitCurator environment:

- bitcurator-distro-salt (https://github.com/bitcurator/bitcurator-distro-salt)
- bitcurator-distro-tools (https://github.com/bitcurator/bitcurator-distro-tools)

The BitCurator environment is a customized respin of Ubuntu. Aside from the initial Ubuntu install, a small number of manual tweaks, and executing the respin tool, the process is fully automated by SaltStack. To get started building and testing a new release, you will need the following:

- The latest Ubuntu 18.04LTS release
- bitcurator-distro-salt (https://github.com/bitcurator/bitcurator-distro-salt)
